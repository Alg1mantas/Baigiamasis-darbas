Here is a simple Flask wheather app. User needs to provide city e.g. : Vilnius, Kaunas etc. It displays: City, Country, Temperature and  Wind speed in given city.
If city name is wrong you will receive N/A.
If you make more than 5 requests per minute, it will also gives you back N/A.
wheather_info.html backround color will change depending on wheather condition in given city. 

When user provides City. App will send request to https://weatherapi-com ...
Request would give you back JSON with 30+  diferrent peaces of weather info. So you can alway modify this appp as you prefer.
Have   a nice day!
